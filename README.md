# Enhancing Crop Prediction and Resource Management

Welcome to the Enhancing Crop Prediction and Resource Management project repository!

## Overview
This project aims to improve crop prediction and resource management for rice, wheat, and corn cultivation by integrating a KNN-based approach with IoT-driven smart irrigation technology. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, our solution optimizes water usage, enhances crop productivity, and promotes sustainability in agriculture.

## Key Features
- **KNN-Based Crop Prediction:** Predicts crop yield based on historical data and environmental factors.
- **IoT-Driven Smart Irrigation:** Monitors soil moisture levels and dynamically adjusts irrigation schedules.
- **Data Analytics:** Analyzes agricultural data to optimize resource allocation and decision-making.
- **Crop-Specific Recommendations:** Provides tailored recommendations for rice, wheat, and corn cultivation.

## ICCICCT-2024 Acceptance
This project has been accepted and presented at the 2nd International Conference on Challenges in Information, Communication, and Computing Technology (ICCICCT-2024).
